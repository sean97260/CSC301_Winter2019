### Part 2: Team Rules



#### Team culture:
Our team’s culture is data-driven, every group member can propose a different solution which supported by a reasonable explanation. Every ideas should have proper reasoning. More importantly, our working environment is friendly and open-minded for any possible solution. We believe that effective communication is the key to build a outstanding team.

#### Team communication:
Channels of communication: WeChat (former channel, now used for casual talks), Slack (currently using for any update in the team)

Our team communication could be done in two ways, via online chatting apps or having a group meeting. All of our team members keep a close contact with each other every day using online chatting, in order to keep every member updated by the latest news and arrangements.

To cooperate with our partner, we use slack and email to keep them updated. Email will be sent on a weekly basis, while other communications will be on Slack. If we cannot reach the partners by slack, we will try to call them or email them. Additionally, considering online chatting could be very inefficient when long discussion is needed for making essential decisions, we keep having a group meeting on weekly basis. 

#### Team meeting:

At the beginning of the semester, every member in our group has updated his/her course schedule onto a sharable doc. By combining everyone’s schedule, we have a clear timetable indicating all possible meeting time for our team. Before the coming of every new week, Yuting in our team will be responsible for making arrangements of our next meeting time, location and attendances. Members who might not be presented will be asked to provide his/her ideas and reasoning about the topic beforehand, or to accept a phone call at meeting time when he/she is physically absent. 

The same mechanics works for our meeting with the partner. Based on our schedule, we send email to confirm a meeting with our partner, with number of team members who will be going. Members might take shifts for each other when someone is busy, but we’re trying to keep every member involved in meeting with the partner.

#### Conflict resolution: 
* Indecision: We vote for decision and go for the one with majority votes.
* Non-responsive team members: Try to set up a face-to-face meeting with them and try to find out/fix any problem with them.
* Not-doing-work: Friendly alarm him and discuss the potential issues.



### Part 3: Events
As it has been mentioned before, we’re having pre-arranged meetings in person on a weekly basis, to discuss about the latest updates of the course, share ideas within the team, check everyone’s progress and give out new tasks. The meeting usually takes place in Bahen Center, 40 St. George Street. In our next meeting after the submission of deliverable 1, we’re planning to have a meeting about the functionalities and product prototype.

Also, we do have online meetings via either voice chatting or texting in a group. This could happen at any time of a day and solves little issues within the team. 

### Part 4: Artifacts
* Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
* We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
    * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

Artifacts that we have in our team construct:
* A schedule containing all available time slots for the team
* A team log that contains all our meeting details and records
* A sharable doc where we post the latest to-do list for the team
* A chatting group on WeChat and Slack

    
We keep every of our team member acknowledged about our current tasks, by sending group notices on WeChat and updating our to-do list in a sharable doc. Everyone in our team can either go to the online doc to see what should be done or check the group messages every day. The priority of every task is decided mostly in our group meetings, based on the level of importance. To ensure that every member is assigned with reasonable work, we split our group into two divisions (frontend and backend). Furthermore, we usually discuss about distribution of jobs right after our group tasks are decided. By selecting one member to be our product manager, we also have someone to keep track of everyone’s progress, so that everyone is ensured to know what he/she is doing at a certain time spot.

## Product
### Part 1: Goals and tasks
The goals in our first iteration will be (listed with priority from high to low):
* Come up with a final decision of our product functionalities, by developing user stories 
* Implementing the basic structure of the frontend, including all sections of functionalities we want to achieve
* Defining the data structures that will be used and stored in our backend
* Preparing testing data and contents that could be used in demonstration

#### Some user stories:
* User story 1:
Tim is one of the people who are in LGBTQQ2SI group. He uses this mobile app to talk to experts in this area when he feels not right. With this app, he could login as a member of this community and talk to people when he needs help. When there is no one available, Tim will receive a message that guides him out of his trouble or keeps him waiting. Tim could stay safe and calm when he is in unstable condition with the help of this function of the app.

* User story 2:
Jenny loves watching news and events on this app, as it makes her feel more involved in this community in Ontario. She uses “add to favourite” function to mark all the interesting posts and events and checks them in her personal account. She could also post event as a member in the community after logging in.

* User story 3:
Jin is a volunteer who is forcing in helping LGBT group people to find their identity. He usually will attend activities that group those people together. The app will remind him the activities start time and location. He know youthline.ca is a website provide lot of resources on helping those people. In activities, he want to show those resources with the people in the activities, but he didn’t carry his laptop with him due to it’s too heavy. With our app, Jin can easily pull out the resources he bookmarked and show it to people around him.

### Part 2: Artifacts
To demonstrate our project idea thoroughly and clearly, we’ll be using multiple ways of presentation, which includes a paragraph of introducing texts, a prototype, some real-life samples that shares our idea and other supporting pictures.
An introduction of our project idea is necessary, as we can provide a formal and official explanation of our product. To enhance the quality of explanation, we could use some existing apps or websites that inspired us. Also, pictures of user stories (in comic form) could be helpful in depicting the purpose of our product. Finally, we will present a prototype of our product app, which will be run in simulation mode of the developing platform. The prototype will show a clear overview of the frontend, including the interface every function we’d like to achieve. Meanwhile, the backend might not be responsive at this stage.
