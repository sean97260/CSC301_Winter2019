 > _Note:_ This document is meant to evolve throughout the planning phase of your project.    
 > That is, it makes sense for you commit regularly to this file while working on the project (especially edits/additions/deletions to the _Highlights_ section).
 > Most importantly, it is a reflection of all the planning you work you've done in the first iteration. 

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to use personas.         
   You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).

    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?

#### Q4: How will you build it?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify any and all languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools.
