   Jin is a volunteer who is forcing in helping LGBT group people to find their identity. He usually will attend activities that group those people together. The app will remind him the activities start time and location. He know youthline.ca is a website provide lot of resources on helping those people. In activities, he want to show those resources with the people in the activities, but he didn’t carry his laptop with him due to it’s too heavy. With our app, Jin can easily pull out the resources he bookmarked and show it to people around him.


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 
   We will do a combination of  mock-ups and images (Low-Fi prototype) 

 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 
   * Mock-ups (Low-Fi prototype) : This will help team members to understand the structures of whole project.

   * images : Images is always good at any cases, this will help us to visually understand what this project can do to its user. (affects )

 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
